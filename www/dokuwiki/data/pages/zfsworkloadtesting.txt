=====ZFS Workload Testing=====

This portion of the documentation will be concerned with the test environment created in the previous section. We'll review some simple scripts that have been created to put a ZFS storage pool under a fairly typical read/write workload so that system resource statistics can be measured and analyzed. The synthetic benchmarking environment is available as a Docker container on [[https://hub.docker.com/r/jcherven/zfsproject/|Docker Hub]]. The workload scripts are available on [[https://github.com/jcherven/zfsproject|Github]].

The Docker image used in this lab requires an Ubuntu 16.04 host with ZFS installed on it. ZFS running in the container requires privileged access to mounts in /proc as well as direct access to block storage on the host. For information on setting this environment up, please see the [[labenvironment|Lab Environment]] section.
