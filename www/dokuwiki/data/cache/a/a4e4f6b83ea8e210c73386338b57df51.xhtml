<div class="level2">

<p>
This portion of the documentation will be concerned with the test environment created in the previous section. We&#039;ll review some simple scripts that have been created to put a ZFS storage pool under a fairly typical read/write workload so that system resource statistics can be measured and analyzed. The synthetic benchmarking environment is available as a Docker container on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jcherven/zfsproject/" class="urlextern" title="https://hub.docker.com/r/jcherven/zfsproject/"  rel="nofollow">Docker Hub</a>. The workload scripts are available on <a href="https://github.com/jcherven/zfsproject" class="urlextern" title="https://github.com/jcherven/zfsproject"  rel="nofollow">Github</a>.

<p>
The Docker image used in this lab requires an Ubuntu 16.04 host with ZFS installed on it. ZFS running in the container requires privileged access to mounts in /proc as well as direct access to block storage on the host. For information on setting this environment up, please see the <a href="/doku.php?id=labenvironment" class="wikilink1" title="labenvironment">Lab Environment</a> section.
