<p>
This section contains some synthetic benchmarks for comparing performance between configurations and should give you guidance when preparing similar tests with your current storage configuration. While performance under actual workloads will vary greatly from those in our virtual environment, it should be possible to create a virtualized simulacra of your environment and configuration and compare them to a ZFS equivalent.
